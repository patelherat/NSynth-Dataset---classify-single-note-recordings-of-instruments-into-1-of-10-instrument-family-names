# NSynth-Dataset---classify-single-note-recordings-of-instruments-into-one-of-10-instrument-family-nam
There are 11 instrument families (e.g., mallet, organ, piano, strings, guitar, etc.), and 3 instrument source types (acoustic instrument sample, electronic instrument sample, or synthesized sample).
<br/>
Dataset:- https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth <br/>

Visualizations:- <br/>
•	Learning curves for training and validation data. <br/> 
•	Visualization of a 1-D audio waveform (sequence of values in [-1,1] representing the volume at each time). <br/>
•	For each class, waveform for samples where the correct class probability is very high, or very low. <br/>
•	For each class, waveforms for samples near the decision boundary, where the probability for the correct class is slightly higher/lower than the other classes. <br/>
•	Confusion matrix, visualizing the frequency of correct classifications and mis-classifications. <br/>
